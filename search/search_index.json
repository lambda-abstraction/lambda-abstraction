well, its kind of like an unsigned contract that:</p> <ul> <li><code>variable_name</code> is believed to have a value of type <code>VariableType</code></li> <li><code>function_name</code> was designed to work when you call it with an argument of type   <code>ParameterType</code>, and is supposed to return a value of type <code>ReturnType</code></li> <li>instances of the <code>ClassName</code> class should have an attribute <code>attribute_name</code>   with a value of type <code>AttributeType</code></li> </ul> <p>tools, like typecheckers and IDE's can do a lot of stuff with this information</p> <p>for example, if you annotated <code>x</code> as a <code>str</code>, then you could get autocompletion of <code>str</code> methods on <code>x</code>, like, you could start typing <code>x.</code>, and stuff like <code>.split()</code> would be suggested</p> <p>typecheckers (like mypy and pyright) can verify that your code does work according to the typehints and doesn't try to access methods that dont exist on the type you annotated (e.g. you typehint <code>x</code> as an <code>int</code>, but try to <code>.split()</code> it: <code>int</code> doesnt have <code>split</code> defined, so it'd spot out this as a type error)</p> <p>the general rule i like to follow is to annotate types of parameters as generic as possible, so they can be reusable in more places, and typehint return values / attributes / values as strict as possible, so it is known exactly what the data is and what you can do with it</p>"},{"location":"python-typehints/builtin-types/","title":"builtin-types","text":"<p>so, what types are there even?
